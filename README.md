# sdl3 imgui example

```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ../
make
```

To produce the issue within imgui and sdl3 logical presentation modes 

```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ../
make -j && ./examples/renderer/09-scaling/09-scaling 
```

From there you should see an imgui drop down, resize the window and select letter box
